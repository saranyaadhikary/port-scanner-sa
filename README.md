# Port Scanner

## Project Description

The Port Scanner is a Python script that allows users to scan a range of ports on a specified host to determine which ports are open. This tool is useful for network administrators and security professionals to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities on a network. The script utilizes multithreading to efficiently scan ports in parallel, making it faster than sequential scanning.

## Features

- **Port Scanning**: Scans a range of ports on a specified host to check if they are open.
- **Multithreading**: Uses multiple threads to perform the scanning in parallel, improving the scanning speed.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the target host and the range of ports to be scanned.
- **Results Display**: Displays the list of open ports found on the target host.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
